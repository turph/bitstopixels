		<p>The second evolution of the ProductAds program was to empower merchants to not only rely on Amazon algorithms to display their product ads, but to create custom campaigns controlling which products could be shown, at what times and where. While this program was mainly intended for merchants looking to run advertisements off Amazon (considered syndication), the merchants would use this tool to also set up their traditional on Amazon product advertising.</p>
		<p>The work below details some of the problem definition, consideration, wireframe and prototyping that went into shaping the application. While the majority of this work was directional in nature and meant to inform internal discussions so of the tool's features were eventually incorporated into SellerCentral.</p>
		<h4>Problem</h4>
		<p>As ProductAds matured, so did merchant's advertising strategies. Merchants desired much more control over how advertising budgets were spent, and this required a complete shift in how the program worked. ProductAds needed to mature from merchants uploading a product feed into the Amazon catalog and relinquished all control over to Amazon targeting systems. Merchants desired a system similar to Google AdWords and Microsoft adCenter, one where they could create and manage complex advertising campaigns handling their spend and reach.</p>
		<h4>Solution</h4>
		<p>Campaign Manager was the tool which would be accessed from a merchant's SellerCentral account and would handle all aspects of creating and managing the various ProductAds programs; On Amazon as well as Off Amazon. The tool was able to walk a user through a stepped approach to define all the various parameters required to make a campaign.</p>

		<h3>Last row</h3>
		<p>Placing the widget slot above pagination at the lost row of results accomplished several goals. Placement gave validity to the results and removed the perception that the widget was simply another ad unit. Also in the natural flow of the visitor, they have scanned down the entire results set and only then would they see alternative options.</p>
		<p>From a design perspective, the goal was to balance the need for separation and identification against the desire to feel associated with the site and not simply appended.</p>
		
		<h5>Chosen direction</h5>
		<p>After some A/B testing rounds between 3 variants, the metrics supported choosing a simple light gray wrapper. The treatment was enough to set the results apart from the organic flow but not interrupt the overall shopping experience. Engagement was within accepted values based on other placements so the program continued to display the widget.</p>

		<p>While the treatment and messaging have evolved over time, the placement and spirit of the original design still is evident today. Products and placements come and go, so hopefully this link will work for you; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_5?url=search-alias%3Dgarden&field-keywords=couch&sprefix=couch%2Caps%2C172">ProductAds placement example</a>.</p>
		
		<h5>Design exploration</h5>
		<p>Several design directions were created, vetted and discarded. Shown below are some of those options.</p>
