		<p>Typically, greater than 60% of first page views on an e-commerce site are a Product Detail page. Today most shoppers are beginning their commerce search on Google, clicking a promising search or product result and being redirected  to this product detail page. In that first instance of pageLoad, visitors make a determination if this product is exactly right, a close match, or completely wrong. You have only a few moments to capture and engage the visitor and influence which segment they will be classified to. This is important since a visitor in a segment eventually has a distinctive experience outcome.</p>
		<div class="chart">
			<span class="chartRight"><iframe height=225 width=375 src="//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17y3aKWaSyJx5xw6KAF-wgwELUIWJs-Yh8Ovjd5ZDK20/gviz/chartiframe?oid=1647659104" seamless frameborder=0 scrolling=no></iframe></span>
		</div>
		<p>Given that visitors landing on a Product Detail page see what can be called the Above the Fold (ATF) section, very few visitors scroll, elements in this region have the greatest opportunity to impact user behavior. This case study focuses on these two visitor segments; Those that proceed to Cart and those proceeding to Related Products with the hypothesis that decreasing experience friction for these segements will decrease visitors exiting the site.</p>
		<p>For the segment of visitors who happen to see the product they would like to purchase then <b><i>proceed through checkout</i></b>, designing experiences which enhance their ability to quickly select a buyable variant and comprehend what the product's discounts and price are is key. For this segment, rethinking the buyBox experience means having better controls for selecting Color and Size, establishing logic for discount messaging and product price displays and allowing visitors to filter to only discounted product.</p>
		<p>For the segment of visitors who instead <b><i>view a suggested product</i></b>, designing affordances which enable visitors to immediately view other products is highly important. For this segment, rethinking what a product detail page means creating a tabbed experience which elevates the ability to explore suggested products above the fold.</p>

		<h3>Visitors proceeding through checkout</h3>
		<h4>Hey, this product is exactly right!</h4>
		<p>Only 5-7% of Product Detail page traffic results in a visitor choosing a product's variants, finding an acceptable price point, adding the item to their cart and proceeding through a checkout process. Not great percentages, so reducing any friction or doubt has a huge impact a visitors experience.</p>
	
		<h5>Variant selection</h5>
		<p>Variant selection is often considered a simple process &mdash; the visitor is selecting a color and a size. Simple operations are usually not so simple.</p>
		<p>Most visitors in testing are very confused as to how the buyBox works on almost all e-commerce sites. They have been trained to know they must select options first, but have very little understanding as to why. When a visitor arrives at a website, and there are no options selected, they are viewing a parent SKU. This parent item is a sum of all its variants, containing all the possible combinations of colors, sizes and prices. For a visitor to actually view a purchasable product they must select a value for each attribute. A real world example of this would be a window display of a shirt, a customer knows they must enter the store to select a size and color to see the actual price.</p>
		<div class="chart"><span class="chartFullWidth"><img src="img/articles/pdp/dropdowns-980.png" alt="Dropdowns 980"></span></div>
		<p><b>So why is this distinction important?</b><br>Insuring a visitor can quickly move from a parent SKU to a buyable product by selecting options allows them add to cart sooner. In the original experience, for a visitor to investigate colors they would have to scroll and interact with elements to discover. Also, option labels are displayed away from the point of interaction and eye focus so visitors needed to always look in two places to associate values.</p>
		<p>Early on in the discovery process, the decision was made to switch to a dropdown opposed to a scrolling component. Once this decision was made, <a href="http://backcountryturph.s3.amazonaws.com/r-BackC/BC.14.0143%20ATF-PDP/3.designDoc/dd_ATFdropdowns-v1.pdf" target="_blank">several options where explored</a> with the end result being what is show above. By consolidating  also solved a technical issue of component reuse across multiple devices as well as UX concerns with the component not working with touch events, and functionality on handheld devices.</p>
		<p>This is a rough prototype of how the dropdowns should behave and was used to give some context to the front-end devs. <a href="http://backcountryturph.s3.amazonaws.com/mockups/2014/BC.14.0143%20ATF-PDP/v1-testDropdowns.html" target="_blank">Dropdown prototype</a></p>
	
		<h5>Discount & price messaging</h5>
		<p>One of the largest contacts to our Call Center involves confusing discount messaging. In the original layout below, color variants display On Sale messaging over the thumbnail. This was an extremely poor design choice as discount messaging is associated with a partial variant selection. Situations arise within the catalog where a colorway may have one price for Small, a Sale price for XXL and an Outlet price for 3XL. This creates conflicts in the display where the visitor is expecting Sale discounts for any size they choose - which in the example above is not true. These customer issues are usually resolved by granting a customer discounts on full priced items.</p>
		<div class="chart"><span class="chartFullWidth"><img src="img/articles/pdp/priceBlocks.png" alt="Pricing and selection"></span></div>
		<p>With a dropdown design solution, discount messaging is only displayed in the pricing area once a buyable variant (size+color) have been selected. This assures that a visitor will only be shown discount messaging and values for the product they have selected.</p>
		<div class="chart"><span class="chartRight"><img src="img/articles/pdp/discountToggle.png" alt="Pricing and selection"></span></div>
		
		<h5>Toggling discounts</h5>
		<p>A segment of our visitors are discount shoppers. For these visitors designing an expereience where they can shop for only products which are discounted is valuable. By creating a toggled experience where a visitor can view only variant options which are either On Sale or Outlet they can concentrate their shopping experience.</p> 
		<p>A tabbed experience based on discount is very different from most buyBox designs. While this concept performed well in user testing sessions, we have no production interaction data to validate this direction. We are encouraged though, based on other metrics from when we launched Outlet inclusion within the buyBox. Data has shown that showing the limited availability of discounted variants has the effect of visitors purchasing full price items because they find those are the only products which either come in the right size or color.</p>
		<p>For quick testing of simple tasks around how users approached the toggling interaction this prototype was used. While extremely limited in functionality, it was enough to gain insight on what click on when asked to complete tasks like finding Sale or Outlet products. <a href="http://backcountryturph.s3.amazonaws.com/mockups/2014/BC.14.0143%20ATF-PDP/v1-pdpRedo.html" target="_blank">Toggle buyBox testing prototype</a>.</p>

		<h3>Visitors selecting suggested product</h3>
		<h4>This product is close, but what is similar?</h4>
		<p>Approximately 3-9% of Product Detail page traffic results in a visitor selecting a different product on the page. For the segment of visitors who feel the product not right but are willing to explore alternatives, designing experiences which enable them to quickly <b><i>view a suggested product</i></b> is immediately important. Most e-commerce sites today have widgets lower on the page recommending products based on several factors. For visitors these suggested products take the burden out of searching and browsing a site's catalog, but the concern is these visitors must scroll down the page to find these options.</p>
		<p>Designing a solution where we can bring options for alternate products into the top of the page gives visitors an immediate option to change from a buying mode to a browsing mode. Selecting a tab would toggle the page and present the user with a full page of options based on the option clicked. While this may distract some purchasers, their are more people looking for a reason to leave the page. So engaging both scenarios is a bigger win.</p>
		<div class="chart"><span class="chartFullWidth"><img src="img/articles/pdp/tabbedNav.png" alt="Navigation"></span></div>
		
		<p>At the present momement there is only one related products widget on the Product Detail page, displaying below the fold in the left rail. The service providing these products is doing so via a system which cascades through various targeting solutions. While CTR on this widget is promising, there are several opportunities which are being explored.</p>
		
		<h5>What goes with this?</h5>
		<p>This page allows for an experience around accessories or matching items. Most items in our catelog have associations with products which either compliment or enhance the parent product. For example, if the parent product is a tent we can surface tent pads, repair kits, vestibules, etc. For a jacket we can suggest matching pants, baselayers or gloves.</p>
		<p>During testing we found visitors were likely to use this type of information to populate Wish Lists. While they were not ready to purchase more items at the present moment they would like to have the ability to mark product for future purchase. Another use case uncovered is visitors would like to be able to look at their order history, find products which they already own, and then begin their shopping experience by looking at products which go with it.</p>
		
		<h5>All jackets</h5>
		<p>This page would allow merchandisers to create experiences which were more category based opposed to product based. User coming into Detail Page often do not know exactly what type of product is best for them. By having a dedicated area to explore products which exist in the same category and not necessarily the lower sub-category.</p>
		
		<h5>Similar products</h5>
		<p>This page would be an opportunity to display more traditional widgets which are on many e-commerce sites today. Having these widgets in one area would enable the user to focus on finding recommended products and not have to scroll through an entire page looking for suggestions.</p>
		
		<h3>Original page interactions</h3>
		<h4>What are visitors clicking on currently?</h4>
		<p>Just a quick note on how some of the design decisions were made. Understanding how visitors are using the page currently greatly informs how designs should be done moving forward. Knowing what elements are used most often, which ones are used infrequently or how a vistors moves on a page is the first place to start.</p>
		<p>Redesign should be seen as a way to structure the page for consumption, not an opportuntiy to be a designer.</p>
		
		<h5>Click data</h5>
		<p>While a visitor may click certain elements more than once per page session and skew results, it is simple to see what is valuable and what is not. Unfortunately the way the current variant selectors and buyBox variations are constructed there is little opportunity to gather information on usage, but we can see all the other elements here. In short, people are looking at variants. </p>

		<h5>Scroll data</h5>
		<p>I mentioned earlier that visitors do not scroll on Product Detail pages. While nothing is an absolute of course, this heat map illustrates just how powerful the Above the Fold area is. Also, another metric that can be taken from this visualization is the height of the viewable space. In the original page, while the variant selector is in the majority view, important elements like the thumbnail carousel and add to cart button is starting to be very close to being out of the hottest view area. Shorter is better. <a href="http://backcountryturph.s3.amazonaws.com/r-BackC/BC.14.0156%20crazyEgg_Archive/detailPage/Desktop/BC%20Detail%20Page,%203-24-2014/Scrollmap%20BC%20Detail%20Page,%203-24-2014.jpg" target="_blank">View the heat map</a>.</p>
