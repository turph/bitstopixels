			<blockquote><p>If you are looking for answers to your complex experience questions on Dribble, you are not doing your job.</p></blockquote>
			<p>A UX Director said this the other day and it has really resonated with me. While I find these types of sites inspirational for interactions or color schemes, they are lacking in problem, solution or answer. Seeing designers start their process here, simply looking to find a design which comes close to solving some part of their problem is discouraging at best.</p>
			<p>Don't get me wrong, I too love these sites. Finding clean layouts or interesting interactions is awesome. So when you walk past my monitor and see me browsing away, I'm not solving that tough problem. Honest.</p>
