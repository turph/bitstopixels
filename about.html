			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>I recently read an interview which I thought was structured in a nice way. I have used the same questions and attempted to answer them the best I could.</p>

			<h4>1. How did you first get started in user experience?</h4>
			<p>Awhile back I was working as an environmental engineer working on contracts inspecting, testing and reporting on hazardous materials on US Navy bases scheduled for closure. This job required collection and analysis of thousands of samples, which on the reporting side required CAD drawings with sample locations and 3 ring binders with sample results. While presenting some report findings, US Navy personnel showed us how another company tied their CAD drawings and database together allowing for clicking on a sample id on a map and seeing the laboratory analysis data on screen. No more reams of maps and binders of sample analysis. From that moment I was hooked.</p>

			<h4>2. Is there a specific aspect of UX design that you are most attracted to?</h4>
			<p>Like most graphic designers entering the UX field, I initially focused on a project's look and feel. But as time as gone by I find myself more attracted to the analytics of Why and discovering opportunities. Fortunately at Backcountry, Product Management and Design are entwined, so when we work well together there is the chance to find potential customer solutions in the data. Digging into Omniture data to better understand user flows along with forming various hypotheses from A/B tests are what I find most appealing about the job today.</p>

			<h4>3. How do you get yourself out of a creative block?</h4>
			<p>I need to get all the good and bad ideas out. I have heard that getting 15 iterations of something out a day is ideal, and while I find this to be overly optimistic, I do try and create as many options as possible. These may be Photoshop versions, wireframes or sketches, but to me the important part is to get them out and then live with them for a while. Sometimes for me it is environment, where depending on my mood I may need to just be in a noisy coffee shop or perhaps a quiet space. Regardless, whatever I produce I find I need to set variations aside and see how I feel about them after several hours - and usually I find that versions I initially liked fade to the back while others come forward. Once I feel like I have found a solid solution to the problem I will talk with colleagues, other UX folks or Product Managers to get feedback and validation of my solutions.</p>

			<h4>4. What are you passionate about outside your work? How does this inspire your work?</h4>
			<p>I love remodeling projects around the house. I have done the full "This Old House" project to complete room demo and makeovers. There is something soothing about working with wood and the process of going from rough framing where you are worried about structural support which ultimately gets covered up and hidden away, to doing finish carpentry where you can put your personal stamp on to a project. I would say the highlight of finish work is going to lumber yards, seeing all the different woods in their raw states and thinking of the potential. All that, and of course running power tools, being covered in dust, drinking coffee out of a paper cup and the joy of at end of the day seeing the progress that you made in front of you.</p>
